Language Lab
------------

Regular daily attendance at the Language Learning and Resource Center (LLARC) for short periods of time (15-20 minutes) is strongly suggested. Please record the time you spend working with the different parts of the tape system both in the lab and at home on the lab log provided ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/mit21g_402s05_lablogsheet)). The lab log will be collected by the instructor with the Workbook/Lab Manual.

Homework
--------

Maximum of 8 hours per week. This includes **daily** practice with the tapes in the LLARC and at home. It is crucial that you work regularly at a station in the LLARC, where you can practice hearing your own recorded voice in comparison with the voice on the tape.
